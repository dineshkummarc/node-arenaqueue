# NodeJS/WebSockets Arena Queue System - Small imprint, big possibilities

Web applications have evolved by utilizing push technologies. If you're building anything where users need to interact with other users to create
a competitive environment, this queue system is just for you. The importance of queue'ing systems is to help users find other players
to play with. Here's some basic code to get you set up, the rest is up to your imagination.

## Examples of Queueing systems

* ChatRoulette 
* Chess Riot 
* World of Warcraft Battleground/Arena queues (finds opponants based on match-making rating)
* Starcraft 2 game finder (finds players within certain leagues to fight against)
* Warcraft 3 game finder (finds players within certain ratings based off of ELO rating system)

## Technologies Used

* NodeJS
* WebSockets
* HTML5/CSS3 for Queue Interface (Much like World of Warcraft?)

## NodeJS Packages

* npm install express
* npm install socket.io (must be a fixed version of it of 0.5.3 from github -- pst me for help with this)
